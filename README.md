# Federated-Cloud-for-Water-Resources
This projects requires access to IBM Cloud. The objective of this project is to implement Federated Cloud model for Water Resource Management assuming we are collaborating with the Water Resource Department. Water resource management tool is one of the tools that are essential to the communities as water is one of our vital substances for survival. In this paper we implemented a water resource management tool using IBM cloud services assuming the Water Resource Department chose the path of using the cloud services to digitize all the operations which include three departments, namely, storage department, billing department, and the administrative department where each department is treated like a ”cloudlet”. Application of cloud computing in this operation could be efficient when it comes to costs and offering of agile services. This project can be useful in similar studies and research fields.
